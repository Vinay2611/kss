			<strong>Introduction</strong><br>
In connection with using the KSS Programs on-line registration services (the “Services”), Khary Stockton Soccer, 
LLC. (“KSS Programs”, “our”, “we”, “us” or applicable derivation) collects Personal Information from users of our 
Services ("You"/"Your"). We respect Your rights with respect to our collection of Your Personal Information and it will 
only be collected, used and disclosed as provided for in this policy or as otherwise specifically consented to by You. 
The policy will apply to and protect Personal Information (as defined below) collected by KSS Programs. <br>
Scope <br>
This policy applies to Personal Information about users of our Services that is collected, used or disclosed to KSS 
Programs in connection with the Services.<br> 
<b>Definitions</b> <br>
To better understand this policy, KSS Programs has set out some basic definitions to use when reading and 
interpreting it. 
Collection: the act of gathering, acquiring, recording, or obtaining Personal Information from any source, including 
 <br>
 
third parties, by any means. <br>
Consent: voluntary agreement to the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information for defined purposes. 
Consent can be either express or implied and can be provided directly by the individual or by an authorized 
representative. Express consent can be given orally, electronically or in writing, but is always unequivocal and does 
not require any inference on the part of KSS Programs. Implied consent is consent that can reasonably be inferred 
from the circumstances or from an individual’s action or inaction. <br>

Disclosure: making Personal Information available to a third party. <br>
Personal Information: information about an identifiable individual that is recorded in any form, but does not include 
aggregated information that cannot be associated with a specific customer. For a customer, such information does 
not include that which is aggregated in such a manner that it cannot be connected to him/her and/or information 
which is publicly listed in a written or online directory or typically made available through directory assistance. 
Use: the treatment, handling and management of Personal Information by and within KSS Programs.<br> 
Collection of Personal Information <br>
As indicated above, we only collect Personal Information that You consciously provide as we provide the Services. 
We may also collect Personal Information if You contact us, through e-mail, telephone conversations or the 
completion of forms, for support and other inquiries.<br> 
Accountability <br>
KSS Programs is responsible for Personal Information under its control and has designated its Privacy Officer as 
accountable for the company’s compliance with the following principles. <br>
1. KSS Programs is responsible for Personal Information in its possession or custody, including information that has 
been transferred by KSS Programs to a third party for processing. KSS Programs shall use contractual or other 
means to provide a comparable level of protection while the information is being processed by such a third party. 
2. KSS Programs shall implement policies and practices to give effect to: <br>
(a) Implementing procedures to protect Personal Information; <br>
(b) Establishing procedures to receive and respond to complaints and inquiries; <br>
(c) Training staff and communicating to staff information about the organization’s policies and practices; and<br> 
(d) Developing information to explain the organization’s policies and procedures. <br>
Purposes and Collection <br>
Where appropriate, KSS Programs will identify the purposes for which Personal Information is collected at or before 
the time the information is collected. <br>
1. KSS Programs collects Personal Information only for the following purposes: 
(a) To provide the Services to our camp or organization customers (“Customers”) or users, including to enroll You at 
Your selected camp(s) or organization(s). In providing the Services, Your Personal Information will be disclosed to 
the camp(s) or organization(s) You have chosen to create an account at; <br>
(b) To establish and maintain responsible commercial relations with Customers and users (which will include, but 
 
 
not be limited to: billing, communication and account verification); 
(c) To meet legal and regulatory requirements; and 
(d) To administer and manage its business operations. 
2. Persons collecting Personal Information directly, other than through the Services, will be able to explain to 
individuals the purposes for which the information is being collected, or will, upon request, refer the individual to a 
designated person at KSS Programs who will explain the purposes. 
3. Unless required by law, KSS Programs shall not use or disclose Personal Information for any purpose other than 
those described above without first identifying and documenting the new purpose and obtaining the consent from 
You, where such consent may not reasonably be implied. <br>
Consent 
The knowledge and consent of the individual are required for the collection, use, or disclosure of Personal 
Information, except in certain circumstances as described below: 
1. In certain circumstances, Personal Information can be collected, used, or disclosed without the knowledge and 
consent of the individual. For example, legal, medical or security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to 
seek consent. When information is being collected for the detection and prevention of fraud or for law enforcement, 
seeking the consent of the individual might defeat the purpose of collecting the information. Seeking consent may 
be impossible or inappropriate where there is an emergency threatening the individual’s life, health or security, or 
where the individual is a minor, seriously ill, or mentally incapacitated. In other instances, information may be 
publicly available. <br>
2. In obtaining consent, KSS Programs will use reasonable efforts to ensure that You are advised of the identified 
purposes for which Personal Information collected will be used or disclosed. <br>
3. The form of consent sought by KSS Programs, in respect of information sought to be collected in association with 
the Services but outside of the completion of the applicable online registration form, may vary depending upon the 
circumstances and type of information disclosed. In determining the appropriate form of consent, KSS Programs 
shall take into account the sensitivity of the Personal Information and the reasonable expectations of its customers 
and employees. <br>
4. Your use of the Services in the completion of online registration form(s) will be considered implied consent to 
collect, use and disclose the associated Personal Information for all identified purposes. <br>
5. You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. KSS 
Programs will inform the individual of the implications of such withdrawal. In order to withdraw consent, You must 
provide notice to KSS Programs in writing. <br>
Use and Retention of Personal Information 
Any Personal Information collected by us will be used solely for the purposes of carrying on our internal business 
affairs and providing KSS Programs Services to You and our customers, and other services as You or our 
customers may request and authorize from time to time. Personal Information will be retained only as long as 
necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes. <br>
1. Generally, all Personal Information collected by KSS Programs is to provide You or our customers with the 
Services (i.e., enroll You or Your children at the selected camp(s) and organization(s)) and will be provided to the 
applicable camp(s) and organization(s) for such purposes as well as for such reasonably ancillary use in 
connection with the operation of such camp(s) and organization(s). We may also disclose Your Personal 
Information to: <br>
 
 
(a) a credit card payment processing company; and 
(b) any other third party, upon receiving Your consent or as required by law. 
2. Only KSS Programs’ employees or our customers with a business need to know, or whose duties reasonably so 
require are granted access to Your Personal Information. 
3. Personal Information that is no longer required to fulfill the identified purposes will be destroyed, erased or made 
anonymous according to the guidelines and procedures established by KSS Programs. It is KSS Programs’ practice 
to retain Your account registration information after You have registered so that in the following year Your 
registration information will be pre-filled to simplify the registration process. 
4. In the event that we disclose Your Personal Information to the third parties described above or to a data storage 
company, as appropriate, KSS Program commits to contractually bind such entities to abide by the fundamental 
terms of this policy and applicable laws, including with respect to their capability to use, disclose and retain such 
Personal Information. <br>
5. Except as provided for in this policy, we will not sell, rent, lease, commercially exploit or otherwise disclose 
Your Personal Information or data to third parties unless: (i) required by law or to cooperate with any bona fide 
legal investigation; (ii) required to protect the legal interests of KSS Programs or our customers, including for 
credit checking and collection purposes, as applicable, or in connection with a potential financing, merger or 
acquisition in which case the applicable counterparties shall be placed under obligations of confidentiality; or 
(iii) You provide consent to such disclosure. 
Accuracy <br>
At Your request and notification, KSS Programs will update Personal Information as necessary to fulfill the identified 
purposes. You always have the right to request that we delete, destroy, return, amend or update Your Personal 
Information in our possession as You may direct, subject to reasonable notice. 
Security <br>
Personal Information will be protected by security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. 
1. Any Personal Information in our possession is stored electronically, either on our server (which may be hosted 
offsite) or on other electronic storage media that may be retained as part of Your files or otherwise. 
2. We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, access to or alteration of Your Personal 
Information and data under our control.<br> 
3. We operate computer networks that are protected by industry standard firewalls and password protection. 
Appropriate physical and managerial security is also in place, including but not limited to the execution by our 
employees of a confidentiality/non-disclosure agreement as a standard practice of our hiring and employment. 
4. KSS Programs will protect Personal Information it discloses to third parties through contractual agreements 
stipulating the confidentiality of the information and the purposes for which it is to be used. 
5. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to Your data will not occur, we will use our resources 
and expertise to attempt to prevent such occurrences. 
6. We commit to providing a minimum of an annual review and training with respect to this policy among our staff 
with potential access to Your Personal Information. 
Openness and Access <br>
 
 
KSS Programs will make readily available to You information about its policies and practices relating to the 
management of Personal Information. KSS Programs will make this Privacy Policy available to You prior to 
providing the Services. On request a copy of this Privacy Policy will be provided by mail. 
You may access or inquire about Your Personal Information in our possession at any time during our business 
hours. The Personal Information requested will be provided within a reasonable time, and at a minimal or no cost to 
You. 
Upon Your request, KSS Programs will be as specific as possible in providing an account of third parties to which it 
has disclosed Your Personal Information. When it is not possible to provide a list of the organizations to which it has 
actually disclosed information about an individual, KSS Programs will provide a list of organizations to which it may 
have disclosed. 
NOTE: In certain situations, KSS Programs may not be able to provide access to all of the Personal Information it 
holds about You. Exceptions may include information that is prohibitively costly to provide, information that contains 
references to other individuals, information that cannot be disclosed for legal, security or commercial proprietary 
reasons, or information that is subject to solicitor-client or litigation privilege. KSS Programs will provide the reasons 
for denying access upon request. 
Challenging Compliance 
In the event of any dispute, complaint or problem with respect to this policy and related KSS Programs practices, a 
definitive procedure for resolution has been established as outlined below. KSS Programs is committed to resolving 
any such issues promptly, justly, objectively and, where possible, confidentially. 
A written outline of the issue should be forwarded directly to the Privacy Officer of KSS Programs, who in turn will 
investigate, examine and evaluate all the facts. On the information gathered and other related details, a formal 
written decision will be completed and will be forwarded to You within 30 days of the Privacy Officer’s receipt of 
Your complaint. During investigation of the issue, it may be necessary for further Personal Information to be shared 
with the Privacy Officer or other appropriate parties internal or external to KSS Programs. In all cases, KSS 
Programs will remain responsible for the protection of all such Personal Information.
